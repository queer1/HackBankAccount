Initially we need to understand how they do this, it is very easy:

1- Hook the keyboard 
2- Hook the mouse
3- Capture a Screen
4- Sniffing Network
5- Image analysis
6- Network analysis

Before for understand this, let's do it!

MouseKeyboardHooking: this contains the project to demostrate this.

ScreenCapture: this contains the project to demostrate this.

AnalysisImageClick: this contains the project to demostrate this.

SniffNework: this contins the project to demostrate this (comming soon fix this, this have problems).

I think is good idea demostrate a basic techniques for this, and not put code ready to hack real account banks, i only show that is possible, but i not upload a tool to hack a real account, the concepts are very simple, and this works for all in the network.
